# sp500-data-fetcher
Introducing the "SP500 Data Fetcher" - your go-to solution for accessing the latest S&P 500 index data, including weights, with ease. This powerful tool enables you to effortlessly retrieve up-to-date information, all conveniently stored in a CSV file.

To obtain the latest data, please note that the source code needs to be manually copied and pasted into the "html_sp500.txt" file. This extra step is necessary due to security measures in place, which prevent automated retrieval of the data. You can find the required source code on the following website: https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500.

Run the following command to install lxml:

```
pip install lxml
```

You are now ready to run the project. Once executed, a CSV file named "sp500_data" will be generated, containing the relevant data. 

Feel free to customize based on any specific instructions or additional requirements for your project.
